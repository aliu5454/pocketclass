        I&apos;m currently based in Vancouver, BC, but I teach all over the world thanks to the power of technology. I&apos;m a certified NCCP Coach, 200-Hour Yoga Alliance certified yoga instructor,
        and a certified hot yoga instructor. I also have 12 years of experience as a national stream gymnast, and 8 years of gymnastics coaching experience. Needless to say, I have a passion for
        fitness and wellness.
