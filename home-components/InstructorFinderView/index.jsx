Julia excels at identifying the specific technical challenges holding you back. Her approach is both incredibly insightful and deeply kind, fostering a truly safe space where learning and making mistakes feels natural. Through her guidance, I learned so much ‚Äì not only refining my technique but also gaining profound self-awareness as a dancer. The knowledge and confidence I gained have directly elevated every single dance class I've attended afterward. Julia is exceptional, and I highly, highly recommend her.

As a female DJ, she brings such a unique energy to her teaching ‚Äî confident, creative, and super inspiring. She‚Äôs incredibly knowledgeable about mixing, transitions, and reading the crowd, but what really sets her apart is how patient and encouraging she is with her students. She creates a fun, supportive space where you‚Äôre not afraid to make mistakes or ask questions. I went from feeling unsure behind the decks to actually being excited to play and experiment, all thanks to her guidance. Whether you‚Äôre just starting out or looking to level up your skills, she‚Äôll help you get there ‚Äî and make you fall in love with DJing along the way. So grateful to have learned from her!",

I trained under her for about a year, and even though I've been dancing for two years, the growth I experienced during my time in her programs and drop-in classes was huge. Julia creates such an encouraging environment where it feels safe to make mistakes and look silly. Whether it was through drills, foundations or choreography, I always felt class feeling inspired and pushed in the best way possible. Overall, I'm super grateful for everything she's taught me so far and for helping me build my foundation as a dancer. Julia is phenomenal! Take the opportunity to learn from her when you can!!!",
